	"description" : "Each clue box has two comments that parents sometimes make to their children. Read each clue box and, of the two comments, pick the one you like better and wish your mom or dad would say to you. Then circle the letter that goes with that comment. Be careful and only circle one letter in each clue box! After you’ve gone through all 20 clue boxes, go back and count how many A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and E’s that you circled. Then write your scores in the blanks at the end of the game. Ask your mom or dad for help if you have any questions. And have fun unlocking the love language mystery! Look at your scores. The highest score represents your primary love language—how you most like to receive love. This doesn’t mean the others aren’t important, it just means that this is your favorite.",
